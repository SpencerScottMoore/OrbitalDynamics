The following is a list of functions and Matlab code used for preliminary orbital determination, along with other functions having to do with orbital dynamics. Each function has a short description in the comments for what each of their purposes is and should give a good idea of what each variable is.

They are all mostly generalized and can be used in whatever circumstance is needed as long as all functions are in the same folder.
